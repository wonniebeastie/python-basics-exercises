# We have a grocery list. As we check off items on that list, from the top of 
# the list to the bottom, we want to remove them from the list.

# Write code that removes the items from grocery_list, one by one, until it is 
# empty. If you print the elements you remove, the expected behavior would look
# as follows.

grocery_list = ['paprika', 'tofu', 'garlic', 'quinoa',
                'carrots', 'broccoli', 'hummus']

while grocery_list:
    print(grocery_list.pop(0))
# paprika
# tofu
# garlic
# quinoa
# carrots
# broccoli
# hummus

print(grocery_list) # []

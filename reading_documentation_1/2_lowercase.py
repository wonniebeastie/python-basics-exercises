# Determine whether Python has a method to lowercase a string, for example 
# converting 'Aloha, World!' into 'aloha, world!.

'Aloha, World!'.lower()  # aloha, world!

"""
Python comes with built-in functions and methods. 

They are all functions but methods are associated with their respective data
types.

I thought that the casefold() string method would be also one but it was not
addressed in the Solution section.

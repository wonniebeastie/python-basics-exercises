# Predict the output of the following code:
if False or True:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')

"""
This code will output:
Yes!

The logical operator `or` is used in the conditional expression for the `if`
statement on line 2. So the condition evaluates to a truthy value if either of
its operands are truthy. 

Since `True` is truthy, the condition evaluates to truthy, printing `'Yes!'`.

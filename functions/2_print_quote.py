# Write a function that prints Bruce Eckel's quote 'Python is executable 
# pseudocode.'. What is the return value of the function?
def bruce_eckel_quote():
    print('Python is executable pseudocode')

bruce_eckel_quote() # Python is executable pseudocode

"""
The return value is `None`, although it will not be outputted since we did not
use the `return` keyword. `None` is the default return value of every function
in Python.
